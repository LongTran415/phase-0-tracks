What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful? They clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer. The most useful ones to me are header and nav because the seem like the most common.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page? Usually header, then nav, then the body with sections/articles/asides/ect, and then the footer.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned a few quick tips like how to use command+control to move elements, and how to use a snippet.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
For me understanding the snippet part was sort of confusing at first. Also the meta charset was a little confusing to understand but towards the end of the exercise our guide gave us a litte insight on why we use them. For example the <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> is to scale your page so it can fit on a phones.

Algorithm for doing laundry:

- Start with a dirty hamper full of clothes.
- Sort laundry into three separate dirty-clothes-piles: colors, whites, and linens.
- Take first pile, put into washer and add detergent.
- Every time a wash is complete:
	- Subtract 1 pile from the dirty-clothes-piles.
	- Put most recently washed pile into the dryer.
	- Take cleaned and dried clothes and set on bed.
	- Repeat until all three dirty-clothes-piles are washed.
- If you are washing the whites pile:
	- Add bleach to your detergent
	- Wash clothes with warm/cold setting
- Otherwise
	- If washing linens:
		- Add fabric softener to your detergent
		- Wash on hot/cold setting
	- If washing colors:
		- Only add detergent.
		- Wash on cold/cold setting
- Take empty hamper and set it next to the bed.
- Separate clean clothes into 4 categories: Tops, Bottoms, underwear/socks, and linens.
- Fold each category separately.
- When the first pile is complete, add pile to the empty hamper
- Repeat until all four categories have filled the hamper.

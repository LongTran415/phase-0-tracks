# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tool that lets you track progess of your all your different repositories. It is useful because it allows you to review and revert changes, and also create back-ups for your code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a "copy" of a respository, you would use one so you can work on the copy rather than a master. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
 
A commit is a save point for a project, and good commit message will describe in detail the changes since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict? 

A merge conflit happens when there is a problem merging or integrating another branch into your current branch, often due to incompatible changes.
